A minimalist typing program inspired by [wpm](https://github.com/cslarsen/wpm) and built for the browser using React, TypeScript, and Redux.
It includes different typing modes such as 'quote', 'random', 'code', and 'repeated-words', and gives you typing stats based on the current text being typed.
Quotes were taken from wpm which were taken from http://www.typeracerdata.com/texts.
